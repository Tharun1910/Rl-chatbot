# 🤖 Personalized Chatbot Using Reinforcement Learning

A conversational AI system built using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to generate personalized, dynamic, and context-aware responses. Unlike traditional rule-based or supervised learning chatbots, this chatbot continuously refines its responses based on user interactions and sentiment-based rewards.

## 📑 Project Overview

This project was developed as a final project for the **Applied Reinforcement Learning (CSC-724-U20)** course at the **University of South Dakota** under the guidance of **Dr. Rodrigue Rizk**.

The chatbot leverages:
- A pre-trained **DistilGPT-2** model for response generation.
- **Sentence-BERT** for query embeddings.
- **Stable-Baselines3 PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** for reinforcement learning.
- **Streamlit** for deploying a clean, interactive user interface.
